This is a Java Swing-based airline management system that provides functionality for both passengers and staff. The application features:

A welcome page with navigation to the main menu

Passenger login and signup functionality with data validation

User profile storage in text files

Flight viewing and booking interface

Staff management sections (currently under development)

Key components include:

Client login/signup forms with input validation

File-based user data storage

Interactive GUI with menus and navigation

Flight search and display functionality

What I Learned
Through developing this project, I gained experience with:

Java Swing GUI Development:

Creating interactive forms and windows

Implementing event handlers and navigation

Working with various Swing components (JFrame, JPanel, JMenu, etc.)

File Handling:

Reading from and writing to text files

Implementing data persistence for user profiles

Validating data before storage

Input Validation:

Checking for required fields

Validating ID and passport number formats

Ensuring unique identifiers

Object-Oriented Programming:

Structuring code into logical classes

Separating UI from business logic

Implementing reusable components

Error Handling:

Using try-catch blocks for file operations

Displaying user-friendly error messages

Graceful handling of edge cases

The project helped me understand the complete lifecycle of a desktop application from UI design to data persistence, while reinforcing core Java programming concepts.
